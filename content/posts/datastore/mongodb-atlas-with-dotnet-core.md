# MongoDB vs. SQL Server Database

## Fundamental Differences

MongoDB and SQL Server represent distinct paradigms in the world of databases.

- **Data Model**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, storing data in BSON (Binary JSON) format with a flexible and dynamic schema. SQL Server, a relational database, relies on a predefined schema.
- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for changes without affecting existing records. SQL Server's rigid schema requires careful schema migrations.
- **Query Language**: MongoDB uses a rich query language supporting JSON-like documents, while SQL Server uses SQL for querying relational data.
- **Scaling**: MongoDB excels at horizontal scaling, distributing data across multiple servers, while SQL Server typically scales vertically by adding more powerful hardware.

# Microservices Architecture with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB Atlas

## Microservices vs. Modular Monolithic

Microservices and modular monolithic architectures offer distinct approaches to application design.

- **Microservices Architecture**: MongoDB Atlas is well-suited for microservices, where applications are composed of small, independent services communicating via APIs. Each microservice can have its MongoDB Atlas database, promoting autonomy.
- **Modular Monolithic Architecture**: MongoDB Atlas can also serve as a centralized database in a modular monolithic architecture, providing scalability for different components of a larger application.
