# Introduction

Entity Framework (EF) Core 6, coupled with ASP.NET Core 6, brings robust data access capabilities to the table, making it a preferred choice for building scalable and modular applications. In this blog post, we will explore the integration of EF Core 6 into an e-commerce system using .NET Core services and APIs.

# What is EF Core 6 in ASP.NET Core 6?

Entity Framework Core 6 is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database access in .NET applications. In the context of ASP.NET Core 6, EF Core serves as the bridge between your application and the underlying database, providing a convenient way to interact with the data layer.

## Why EF Core 6 and Problem Resolution

The integration of EF Core 6 with ASP.NET Core 6 addresses several critical issues in modern application development. It streamlines data access code, reduces boilerplate, and allows developers to focus on business logic rather than intricate SQL queries. The use of EF Core 6 promotes maintainability, testability, and overall productivity.

## Microservices and Modular Monolithic Considerations

In the realm of microservices or modular monolithic architectures, EF Core 6 offers flexibility. It can be used in individual microservices, each managing its own database, or as part of a modular monolith, where multiple services share a common database. The choice depends on the specific requirements and design principles of the application.

# Implementation in an E-commerce System

Let's dive into the practical implementation of EF Core 6 in an e-commerce system built with .NET Core services and APIs. The following snippets showcase key aspects such as repository and unit of work patterns, AutoMapper for object mapping, in-memory database usage, and unit testing with Testcontainers and xUnit.

## Project Structure

Before diving into the code, let's outline the project structure. A typical e-commerce system might have the following structure:

```plaintext
ECommerceSystem
|-- ECommerce.API
|   |-- Controllers
|   |-- Services
|   |-- Models
|-- ECommerce.Data
|   |-- Entities
|   |-- Repositories
|   |-- UnitOfWork
|-- ECommerce.Tests
|   |-- UnitTests
|   |-- IntegrationTests
|-- AutoMapperProfiles
|-- ECommerce.sln
```

- ECommerce.API: Contains the API controllers and services responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- ECommerce.Data: Houses the data layer, including entities, repositories, and the unit of work.
- ECommerce.Tests: Holds unit and integration tests for the application.
- AutoMapperProfiles: Stores AutoMapper profiles for object mapping configurations.

## .Net Core API for Product Endpoint

Let's create a simple .NET Core API for managing products in the ECommerce.API project.

```csharp
// ECommerce.API/Controllers/ProductController.cs
[ApiController]
[Route("api/products")]
public class ProductController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IProductService _productService;

    public ProductController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetProducts()
    {
        var products = _productService.GetAllProducts();
        return Ok(products);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult AddProduct([FromBody] ProductDto productDto)
    {
        var addedProduct = _productService.AddProduct(productDto);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetProducts), new { id = addedProduct.Id }, addedProduct);
    }
}
```

## Repository and Unit of Work Pattern

Let's implement the repository and unit of work pattern for managing products in the ECommerce.Data project.

```csharp
// ECommerce.Data/Repositories/ProductRepository.cs
public class ProductRepository : IRepository<Product>
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public ProductRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll()
    {
        return _context.Set<Product>().ToList();
    }

    // Implement other CRUD operations here
}

// ECommerce.Data/UnitOfWork/UnitOfWork.cs
public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
        Products = new ProductRepository(_context);
    }

    public IRepository<Product> Products { get; }

    public int Complete()
    {
        return _context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```

## AutoMapper for Object Mapping

Configure AutoMapper to handle the mapping between entities and DTOs in the AutoMapperProfiles project.

```csharp
// AutoMapperProfiles/MappingProfile.cs
public class MappingProfile : Profile
{
    public MappingProfile()
    {
        CreateMap<Product, ProductDto>();
        CreateMap<ProductDto, Product>();
        // Additional mappings can be defined here
    }
}

// In Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(MappingProfile));
}
```

## EF Core 6 In-Memory Repository

Let's set up EF Core 6 with an in-memory repository for testing purposes.

```csharp
// ECommerce.Tests/DatabaseFixture.cs
public class DatabaseFixture : IDisposable
{
    public DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> DbContextOptions { get; private set; }

    public DatabaseFixture()
    {
        // Set up in-memory database options
        DbContextOptions = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<AppDbContext>()
            .UseInMemoryDatabase("TestDatabase")
            .Options;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Clean up resources
    }
}

// ECommerce.Tests/IntegrationTests/ProductServiceTests.cs
[Collection("Database collection")]
public class ProductServiceTests
{
    private readonly DatabaseFixture _fixture;

    public ProductServiceTests(DatabaseFixture fixture)
    {
        _fixture = fixture;
    }

    [Fact]
    public void CanAddProduct()
    {
        using (var context = new AppDbContext(_fixture.DbContextOptions))
        {
            // Initialize repository, unit of work, and service
            var repository = new ProductRepository(context);
            var unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork(context);
            var productService = new ProductService(repository, unitOfWork);

            // Test logic for adding a product
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

This structure sets the foundation for a scalable and modular e-commerce system, utilizing EF Core 6, ASP.NET Core 6, and additional testing tools for robust development and maintenance.
