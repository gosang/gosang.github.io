As LLMs become increasingly central to modern software applications, one persistent challenge is managing how models retain, reference, and interact with context across different interactions. This is where Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes into play — an architectural pattern and protocol designed to optimize, standardize, and streamline how context is managed in LLM-powered systems.

In this blog post, we’ll explore:

- What MCP is
- Why it’s important
- Key concepts and functions
- How to implement it
- Pros and cons
- Use cases, issues, and best practices
