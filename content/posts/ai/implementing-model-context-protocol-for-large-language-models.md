As LLMs become increasingly central to modern software applications, one persistent challenge is managing how models retain, reference, and interact with context across different interactions. This is where Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes into play â€” an architectural pattern and protocol designed to optimize, standardize, and streamline how context is managed in LLM-powered systems.

In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore:

- What MCP is
- Why itâ€™s important
- Key concepts and functions
- How to implement it
- Pros and cons
- Use cases, issues, and best practices

# ðŸ“Œ What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a structured framework or protocol designed to manage the contextual memory and state of a conversation or task handled by a large language model. It defines how context (e.g., history, goals, user preferences, task progress) is structured, stored, retrieved, and injected into interactions with the model.

MCP is not a single library or tool â€” itâ€™s a design pattern or architecture that can be implemented using various tools (e.g., vector databases, metadata tagging, session management).

## âœ… Why MCP?

LLMs, even advanced ones like GPT-4 or Claude, are stateless by design. They process inputs without any inherent memory of prior interactions unless context is passed manually.
