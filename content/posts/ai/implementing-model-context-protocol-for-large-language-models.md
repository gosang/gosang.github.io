As LLMs become increasingly central to modern software applications, one persistent challenge is managing how models retain, reference, and interact with context across different interactions. This is where Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes into play ‚Äî an architectural pattern and protocol designed to optimize, standardize, and streamline how context is managed in LLM-powered systems.

In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore:

- What MCP is
- Why it‚Äôs important
- Key concepts and functions
- How to implement it
- Pros and cons
- Use cases, issues, and best practices

# üìå What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a structured framework or protocol designed to manage the contextual memory and state of a conversation or task handled by a large language model. It defines how context (e.g., history, goals, user preferences, task progress) is structured, stored, retrieved, and injected into interactions with the model.

MCP is not a single library or tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a design pattern or architecture that can be implemented using various tools (e.g., vector databases, metadata tagging, session management).

## ‚úÖ Why MCP?

LLMs, even advanced ones like GPT-4 or Claude, are stateless by design. They process inputs without any inherent memory of prior interactions unless context is passed manually.

Without MCP, systems face:

- Redundant prompts
- Loss of task continuity
- Higher token usage (more expensive)
- Poor user experience

By applying MCP, developers can:

- Preserve context across long interactions
- Inject relevant prior knowledge
- Minimize prompt engineering
- Enable multi-turn, goal-oriented conversations

## üß† Key Concepts

Here are the essential building blocks of MCP:
| Component | Description |
|------|-----|
|Session Context |A data object representing the current interaction scope|
|Context Store |Persistent memory (DB/vector store) for storing prior interactions/data|
|Retriever|A function to fetch relevant context snippets dynamically|
|Injector|Merges retrieved context with the new prompt in a structured format|
|Context Policy| Rules defining what gets stored, for how long, and when it should be used|

# üîß Implementing MCP for LLMs (Step-by-Step)

Here‚Äôs a simplified implementation example using Python and LangChain with a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone).

#### 1. Define the Session Context

```python
class SessionContext:
    def __init__(self, session_id):
        self.session_id = session_id
        self.metadata = {}
        self.history = []  # Can include user inputs, model responses, task metadata
```

#### 2. Store Context in a Vector DB

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

vector_store = FAISS(OpenAIEmbeddings())
def store_context(session_ctx, text):
    vector_store.add_texts([text], metadatas=[{"session": session_ctx.session_id}])
```

#### 3. Retrieve Relevant Context

```python
def retrieve_context(session_ctx, query, top_k=5):
    return vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=top_k, filter={"session": session_ctx.session_id})
```

#### 4. Inject Context into Prompt

```python
def create_prompt(context_snippets, user_input):
    context_block = "\n".join(["- " + snippet.page_content for snippet in context_snippets])
    return f"""Context:\n{context_block}\n\nUser Input:\n{user_input}\n\nResponse:"""
```

#### 5. LLM Invocation

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI()

context_snippets = retrieve_context(session_ctx, user_input)
prompt = create_prompt(context_snippets, user_input)
response = llm(prompt)
```

This approach can scale with Redis, Pinecone, Weaviate, or PostgreSQL for context storage.
