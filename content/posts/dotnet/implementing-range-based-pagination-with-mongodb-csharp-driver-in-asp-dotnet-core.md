Pagination is essential for handling large datasets efficiently in web applications. While traditional offset-based pagination (using skip and limit) works well for small datasets, it can become inefficient for large collections due to performance degradation. Range-based pagination, also known as keyset pagination, is a more performant alternative that uses indexed fields (like timestamps or IDs) to retrieve results.

This blog post will explain how to implement Range-Based Pagination with the MongoDB C# driver in ASP.NET Core 8, covering:

- What Range-Based Pagination is and why it is needed.
- Key concepts, functions, and implementation details.
- A practical C# implementation in an ASP.NET Core 8 API.
- Advantages, disadvantages, and best practices.

# What is Range-Based Pagination?

Range-Based Pagination retrieves a limited number of records based on a range condition rather than skipping a certain number of records. Instead of using skip, we use a continuation token (e.g., a timestamp or an ID from the last retrieved document) to get the next batch.

## Why Range-Based Pagination

- **Performance Optimization**: Unlike offset-based pagination, range queries use indexes efficiently, making queries faster.
- **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets by avoiding costly skip operations.
- **Consistent Ordering**: Prevents inconsistencies when new records are inserted or removed.
- **Reduced Latency**: Provides faster response times for paginated queries.

## Key Concepts of Range-Based Pagination

- **Cursor/Continuation Token**: Instead of a numeric page index, a cursor (such as a timestamp or document ID) is used to determine the starting point for the next page.

**Indexed Sorting**: Sorting by an indexed field ensures efficient querying and consistency in pagination.

**Filtering and Ordering**: Results are filtered based on the cursor, ensuring only newer (or older) records are retrieved.

- **Page Size**: Specifies the number of records retrieved per request.
