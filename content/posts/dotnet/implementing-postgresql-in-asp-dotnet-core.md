PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that has gained significant traction in modern web applications. It is known for its powerful features, high compliance with SQL standards, and flexibility in handling complex queries and data types. With ASP.NET Core 8, developers can integrate PostgreSQL seamlessly into their web applications, leveraging its performance and reliability to build scalable, high-performing systems.

This blog covers the integration of PostgreSQL with ASP.NET Core 8, including an overview of PostgreSQL, a comparison with other databases like SQL Server and MongoDB, and the step-by-step implementation of a CRUD API project. We will also look into best practices and recommendations for building scalable applications using PostgreSQL and ASP.NET Core 8.

# What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database system (ORDBMS) with a strong emphasis on standards compliance and extensibility. Initially released in 1996, it has since become one of the most reliable and versatile database systems. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) queries, making it suitable for handling structured and unstructured data.
