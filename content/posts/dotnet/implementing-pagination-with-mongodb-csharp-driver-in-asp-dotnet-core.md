Pagination is a crucial aspect of application development, especially when dealing with large datasets in databases. It ensures that data is fetched in manageable chunks, improving performance and user experience. In this blog, we’ll explore how to implement pagination using the MongoDB C# driver in an ASP.NET Core 8 API project. We’ll cover the key concepts, functions, and best practices while discussing when and when not to use pagination.

# What is Pagination?

Pagination refers to the process of dividing a dataset into discrete pages. When querying large databases, fetching all records at once can be resource-intensive. Pagination helps limit the number of records returned, making the system more scalable, responsive, and user-friendly.

In MongoDB, pagination is commonly implemented using a combination of the `skip` and `limit` functions in conjunction with sorting mechanisms to ensure the data is retrieved in a consistent order.

## Why Pagination?

- **Performance**: Querying large datasets can cause performance bottlenecks. Pagination limits the number of records returned at a time, improving API response time.

- **Usability**: Returning large amounts of data in a single response can overwhelm the user interface. Pagination enhances user experience by showing data in smaller, manageable chunks.

- **Scalability**: As datasets grow, pagination helps scale the system efficiently by controlling resource utilization.

## 1. `skip`:

The `skip` function is used to skip a certain number of records in a dataset. This is helpful when moving to subsequent pages.
