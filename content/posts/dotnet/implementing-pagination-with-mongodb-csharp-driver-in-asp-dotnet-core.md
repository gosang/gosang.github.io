Pagination is a crucial aspect of application development, especially when dealing with large datasets in databases. It ensures that data is fetched in manageable chunks, improving performance and user experience. In this blog, we’ll explore how to implement pagination using the MongoDB C# driver in an ASP.NET Core 8 API project. We’ll cover the key concepts, functions, and best practices while discussing when and when not to use pagination.

# What is Pagination?

Pagination refers to the process of dividing a dataset into discrete pages. When querying large databases, fetching all records at once can be resource-intensive. Pagination helps limit the number of records returned, making the system more scalable, responsive, and user-friendly.

In MongoDB, pagination is commonly implemented using a combination of the `skip` and `limit` functions in conjunction with sorting mechanisms to ensure the data is retrieved in a consistent order.

## Why Pagination?

- **Performance**: Querying large datasets can cause performance bottlenecks. Pagination limits the number of records returned at a time, improving API response time.

- **Usability**: Returning large amounts of data in a single response can overwhelm the user interface. Pagination enhances user experience by showing data in smaller, manageable chunks.

- **Scalability**: As datasets grow, pagination helps scale the system efficiently by controlling resource utilization.

# Key Concepts of Pagination with MongoDB C\# Driver

## 1. `skip`:

The `skip` function is used to skip a certain number of records in a dataset. This is helpful when moving to subsequent pages.

## 2. `limit`:

The `limit` function is used to specify the maximum number of records to return in a query result. It defines the size of the page.

## 3. Sorting:

Pagination often requires a stable sort order to ensure consistency across pages. Without sorting, records may be returned in arbitrary order, which can lead to inconsistencies when paginating.

## 4. Filters:

You can apply filtering conditions to ensure that the paginated results meet specific criteria before being returned.

## 5. Page Number and Page Size:

These parameters dictate which page of the data is returned and how many records should be included on each page.

# Implementing Pagination in ASP.NET Core with MongoDB C\# Driver

Let’s walk through a step-by-step implementation of pagination in a sample ASP.NET Core 8 API project that uses MongoDB as the data store.

## Setting up MongoDB and ASP.NET Core 8

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson
```
