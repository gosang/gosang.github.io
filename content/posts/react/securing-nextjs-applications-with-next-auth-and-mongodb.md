- **Scalability**: As applications grow, so do authentication requirements. Next-Auth supports scalability, adapting to the needs of both small and large projects.

# Getting Started with Next-Auth in Next.js 13

In the context of a React Next.js 13 application, let's dive into the implementation of Next-Auth Credentials using MongoDB for user registration, login, and logout. We'll utilize React 18, Next.js 13, Prisma for ORM and schema, and the Vitest testing framework for unit tests.

## Installation

To get started with Next-Auth in a Next.js 13 project, first install the required dependencies:

```bash
// Create a new next.js project if needed
npx create-next-app@latest
// follow the steps as needed

// Install Next-Auth
npm install next-auth

// Install Prisma for ORM
npm install prisma
npm i @prisma/client bcryptjs
npm i -D ts-node prisma @types/bcryptjs

// Install vitest for unit tests
npm install vitest
```

## Configuration

Configure related Next-Auth Credentials, API route, Session, Providers, Layout:

### Sample Next-Auth Credentials

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
import type { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials";

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: "Sign in",
      credentials: {
        email: {
          label: "Email",
          type: "email",
          placeholder: "test@test.com",
        },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        const user = { id: "1", name: "test", email: "test@test.com" };
        return user;
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Sample API Route for GET and POST

```typescript
// src/app/api/auth/[â€¦nextauth]/route.ts

import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth";
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);
export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```

### Sample Session in an API Route

```typescript
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth";
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);

  return NextResponse.json({
    authenticated: !!session,
    session,
  });
}
```

### Sample Session Provider

```typescript
// src/app/providers.tsx

"use client";

import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

type Props = {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
};

export const NextAuthProvider = ({ children }: Props) => {
  return <SessionProvider>{children}</SessionProvider>;
};
```

### Setup Prisma ORM

Setting up Prisma with MongoDB includes creating the datasource provider for MongoDB and scehma for the data model.

#### Create datasource provider

```bash
npx prisma init --datasource-provider mongoDB
```

#### Prisma schema

```typescript
// prisma/schema.prisma

// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mongoDB"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id       String @id @default(uuid())
  name     String
  email    String @unique
  password String
}

```

#### PrismaClient Instance

```typescript
// src/lib/prisma.ts

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma ||
  new PrismaClient({
    log: ["query"],
  });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
```

## Implementation in React Next.js 13 Application

### Registration

Implementing user registration involves creating a registration form and handling form submission:

#### Sample typescript code for registration

```typescript
// pages/register.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const Register = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

  const handleRegistration = async () => {
    // Perform registration logic using Next-Auth
    const result = await fetch("/api/auth/register", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),
    });

    if (result.ok) {
      // Redirect to login page upon successful registration
      router.push("/login");
    } else {
      // Handle registration error
      // ...
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Register</h1>
      {/* Registration form */}
      <form>
        {/* Form fields for email and password */}
        <button onClick={handleRegistration}>Register</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Register;
```

### Login

Creating a login page involves similar steps, handling form submission and redirecting upon successful login:

#### Sample typescript code for login

```typescript
// pages/login.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const Login = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

  const handleLogin = async () => {
    // Perform login logic using Next-Auth
    const result = await fetch("/api/auth/login", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),
    });

    if (result.ok) {
      // Redirect to dashboard upon successful login
      router.push("/dashboard");
    } else {
      // Handle login error
      // ...
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      {/* Login form */}
      <form>
        {/* Form fields for email and password */}
        <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;
```

### Logout

Logging out can be implemented by calling the Next-Auth signOut function:

#### Sample typescript code for logout

```typescript
// pages/profile.tsx
import { useSession, signOut } from "next-auth/react";

const Profile = () => {
  const { data: session } = useSession();

  const handleLogout = () => {
    // Sign out using Next-Auth
    signOut();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {session?.user?.name || "Guest"}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

In this example, we use the Credentials provider for custom email/password authentication. The Prisma adapter seamlessly integrates Next-Auth with the MongoDB database.
