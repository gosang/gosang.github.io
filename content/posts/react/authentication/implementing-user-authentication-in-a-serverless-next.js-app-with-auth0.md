Securing modern web applications is essentialâ€”but building authentication from scratch is risky, time-consuming, and error-prone. With frameworks like Next.js embracing the serverless architecture, integrating secure user authentication becomes more nuanced. Auth0, a leading Identity-as-a-Service provider, offers a powerful, battle-tested solution.

In this blog, weâ€™ll walk you through implementing user authentication in a serverless Next.js app using the latest Auth0 SDK, covering concepts, TypeScript code examples, common pitfalls, and best practices. This post reflects updates as of 2025, including Next.js 14+ and Auth0 SDK refinements.

# What is Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible, easy-to-implement authentication and authorization platform. It allows developers to add secure login, logout, and access control features to applications without having to manage user credentials manually.

# ðŸ§  What Is Auth0 Authentication in Next.js?

Auth0 handles identity management so you donâ€™t have to build login/logout/session logic from scratch. In a serverless Next.js environment, user authentication is achieved via API routes and middleware that handle identity flow while keeping

## âœ… Why Use Auth0 with Next.js?

**Security**: Auth0 provides robust security features like password hashing, multi-factor authentication, and compliance with industry standards (secure & compliant out-of-the-box such as OAuth2.0, OIDC, PKCE, etc.).
**Ease of Integration**: SDKs and documentation make it straightforward to implement. Supports social logins, passwordless, enterprise SSO, etc.
**Scalability**: Scales easily, from small projects to enterprise apps, handles millions of users efficiently.
**Serverless Compatibility**: Its APIs are serverless-friendly and well-suited for Next.js (serverless API routes and middleware) apps.

## ðŸ§© Core Concepts in Auth0

**Application**: A representation of your Next.js app in Auth0.
**Client ID & Secret**: Credentials used for authenticating the app.
**Connections**: Define how users authenticate (e.g., email/password, social login).
**Tokens**: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for securely transferring authentication information.

## Key Features in Auth0 Integration

**Authentication**: Validates user credentials and issues tokens.
**Authorization**: Grants or denies access based on user roles or permissions.
**Session Management**: Maintains logged-in user states across sessions.

# Step-by-Step Implementation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed.
- A Next.js app set up.
- An Auth0 account.

## 1. Install Required Packages

```bash
npm install @auth0/nextjs-auth0
npm install --save-dev @types/auth0
```

## 2. Configure Auth0

Create a new application in Auth0 and obtain:

- Domain (e.g., your-domain.us.auth0.com)
- Client ID
- Client Secret

Update your `.env.local` file:

```typescript
AUTH0_SECRET=<RANDOM_SECRET>
AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
```

## 3. Set Up Auth0 Middleware

Create a `pages/api/auth/[...auth0].ts` file:

```typescript
import { handleAuth } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";

export default handleAuth();
```

This middleware handles all Auth0 routes (e.g., login, logout, callback).

## 4. Protect Pages with Auth0

Use server-side rendering (SSR) to protect pages:

```typescript
import { withPageAuthRequired } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";

const ProtectedPage = ({ user }: { user: any }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export const getServerSideProps = withPageAuthRequired();

export default ProtectedPage;
```

This ensures that only authenticated users can access the page.

## 5. Add Login and Logout Buttons

Add login/logout functionality to your app:

```typescript
import Link from "next/link";

const NavBar = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/api/auth/login">Login</Link>
      <Link href="/api/auth/logout">Logout</Link>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default NavBar;
```
