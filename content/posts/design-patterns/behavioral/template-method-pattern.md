The Template Method Pattern is a fundamental design pattern in software development that provides a framework for defining the structure of an algorithm while allowing specific steps of the algorithm to be implemented by derived classes. In this blog, we will explore the Template Method Pattern in detail, including its rationale, how it's used in C# .NET Core, and its relevance in both microservices and modular monolithic applications. We'll also look into its advantages and disadvantages, use cases, best practices, and recommendations.

# What is the Template Method Pattern?

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method but delegates some of its steps to subclasses. It falls under the category of the "Gang of Four" design patterns and is widely used to create reusable algorithm frameworks.

# Rationale

The primary goal of the Template Method Pattern is to provide a template or blueprint for an algorithm while allowing specific variations or implementations of certain steps. This pattern promotes code reuse, enhances maintainability, and enforces a consistent structure for algorithms across the application.

# How the Template Method Pattern Works

Let's dive into the core components of the Template Method Pattern:

- **Abstract Class**: The pattern starts with the creation of an abstract class that defines the basic structure of the algorithm. This class contains a method (the "template method") that outlines the algorithm's steps.

- **Concrete Subclasses**: Subclasses inherit from the abstract class and implement the specific steps of the algorithm. These implementations are then called by the template method.

- **Template Method**: This method defines the overall algorithm and orchestrates the execution by invoking the specific steps. It's often marked as final to prevent subclasses from altering the algorithm's structure.

# C# .NET Core Example

Suppose we're developing a C# .NET Core Web API that interacts with a database using a repository pattern. Here's an example of how the Template Method Pattern can be applied:

```csharp
public abstract class Repository
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        OpenConnection();
        // Specific database operations
        CloseConnection();
    }

    protected abstract void OpenConnection();
    protected abstract void CloseConnection();
}

public class SqlRepository : Repository
{
    protected override void OpenConnection()
    {
        // Code to open a SQL connection
    }

    protected override void CloseConnection()
    {
        // Code to close a SQL connection
    }
}

public class MongoRepository : Repository
{
    protected override void OpenConnection()
    {
        // Code to open a MongoDB connection
    }

    protected override void CloseConnection()
    {
        // Code to close a MongoDB connection
    }
}
```

In this example, the Repository class defines a template method Execute, while the SqlRepository and MongoRepository subclasses provide specific implementations for opening and closing connections to SQL and MongoDB databases, respectively.

# Advantages and Disadvantages

## Advantages

- **Reusability**: The Template Method Pattern promotes code reuse by defining a common algorithm structure.
- **Consistency**: It enforces a consistent algorithm structure across subclasses.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the algorithm can be made in one place (the template method) without affecting the subclasses.

## Disadvantages

- **Inflexibility**: The pattern can be inflexible when there's a need for significant variations in the algorithm structure.
- **Complexity**: Overusing the Template Method Pattern can lead to overly complex class hierarchies.

# When to Use the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is most beneficial in the following scenarios:

- **Common Algorithm Structure**: When you have several classes with a shared algorithm structure but different implementations for specific steps.
- **Enforcing Consistency**: When you want to enforce a consistent structure for related algorithms.
- **Reducing Code Duplication**: To avoid code duplication by centralizing the algorithm's structure.

# Use Cases and Scenarios

- **Database Access**: As shown in our example, database access operations often share a common structure, making the Template Method Pattern useful.
- **HTTP Request Handling**: In web applications, handling incoming HTTP requests can follow a common structure with variations in request processing.

**Best Practices**

- **Keep the Template Method Simple**: The template method should contain only the core algorithm structure, keeping it clean and easy to understand.
- **Use Hook Methods Sparingly**: Avoid creating too many hook methods (methods that can be overridden by subclasses) to maintain simplicity.
- **Consider Dependency Injection**: When applicable, use dependency injection to provide the specific behavior to the template method.

# Conclusion

The Template Method Pattern is a valuable tool for creating reusable and consistent algorithm structures. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you want to maintain a clear and predictable structure in your application. By applying this pattern thoughtfully in your C# .NET Core projects, you can enhance code maintainability and reduce duplication, leading to more robust and efficient software.

For more in-depth information, you can refer to the classic book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (the "Gang of Four"). You can also find additional resources on the official [C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

That's all for our exploration of the Template Method Pattern in C# .NET Core. Happy coding!
