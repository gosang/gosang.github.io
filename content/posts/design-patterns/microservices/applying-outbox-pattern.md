In the realm of microservices architectures, managing distributed transactions and ensuring data consistency across services can be challenging. The Outbox Design Pattern is a powerful solution to address these challenges, by facilitating the decoupling of business logic from the intricacies of distributed transactions. It aims to ensure atomicity and consistency of operations across multiple microservices or components.

In this blog, we will look into applying the Outbox Design Pattern in a simple problem. By introducing an "outbox" table to store events, this pattern separates concerns, providing a cleaner and more fault-tolerant approach to managing distributed transactions. In this refined scenario, we will explore how the Outbox Design Pattern can enhance the reliability of an e-commerce application using Entity Framework Core 6, addressing potential pitfalls associated with combined logic in the order repository.

# The Problem with Combined Logic in Order Repository

In a sample e-commerce implementation, the OrderRepository is responsible for both persisting orders and triggering email notifications and event publishing. Although this may seem convenient, it introduces potential issues, especially when dealing with distributed systems.

Consider the following snippet:

```csharp
public class OrderRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _dbContext;
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;
    private readonly EventBus _eventBus;

    public OrderRepository(DbContext dbContext, EmailService emailService, EventBus eventBus)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
        _emailService = emailService;
        _eventBus = eventBus;
    }

    public async Task SubmitOrder(Order order)
    {
        using var transaction = _dbContext.Database.BeginTransaction();

        _dbContext.Set<Order>().Add(order);

        try
        {
            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();

            // Send email and publish event
            await _emailService.SendOrderConfirmationEmail(order);
            await _eventBus.PublishAsync(OrderCreated.New(order));

            transaction.Commit();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            transaction.Rollback();
            // Handle exception (logging, retry, etc.)
        }
    }
}
```

## Potential Problems:

- **Email Sending Failure**: If the order is successfully stored but the email sending fails, the system is left in an inconsistent state. The customer receives no confirmation, and downstream systems are unaware of the order.

- **Event Bus Failure**: If both the order and email are successful, but the event bus fails, downstream systems won't be notified, leading to inconsistent state.

# Introducing the Outbox Design Pattern

To address these issues, let's separate concerns and implement the Outbox Design Pattern. We will introduce an Outbox table to store events that need to be published, ensuring atomicity in local operations and improving fault tolerance.

#### Code Refinement:

```csharp
public class OrderRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _dbContext;
    private readonly EventBus _eventBus;

    public OrderRepository(DbContext dbContext, EventBus eventBus)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
        _eventBus = eventBus;
    }

    public async Task SubmitOrder(Order order)
    {
        using var transaction = _dbContext.Database.BeginTransaction();

        _dbContext.Set<Order>().Add(order);

        try
        {
            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();

            // Outbox: Insert event into the outbox table
            _dbContext.Set<OutboxEvent>().Add(new OutboxEvent
            {
                EventType = EventType.OrderSubmitted,
                EventData = Serialize(order),
                CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
            });

            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(); // Save outbox event

            transaction.Commit();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            transaction.Rollback();
            // Handle exception (logging, retry, etc.)
        }
    }
}
```

With this modification, the OrderRepository is solely responsible for database operations, while the event publishing logic is encapsulated within the OutboxEvent.

#### Addressing Potential Problems:

- **Email Sending Failure**: Even if the email fails, the order is successfully stored, and the event is added to the outbox. Downstream systems can process the event later, ensuring eventual consistency.

- **Event Bus Failure**: In case of an event bus failure, the order is still persisted, and the event is in the outbox. Systems can retry publishing events from the outbox, ensuring fault tolerance.

By applying the Outbox Design Pattern, we've improved the resilience and consistency of the system in the face of failures during various stages of order processing. This separation of concerns allows for more robust error handling and better overall system reliability.
