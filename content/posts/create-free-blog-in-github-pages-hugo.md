# Context

When we learn something about technology, we might want to write and share about our experience, possibly in a website. An easy way to author and share technical content is to create a blog and share your technology experience with others on the Internet. Ideally, we want to explore a free option when creating and maintaining a blog:

- No/Low-Cost - Free or as close to free as possible.
- Productive - Easy to write in and easy to maintain.
- Cloud Native - Utilizes public cloud services for hosting, allowing for infinite scaling.

We can use the following technologies to accomplish these goals:

- Markdown - A markup language that is extremely easy to read natively, easy to write in, and can be easily converted into HTML.
- Hugo - A static site generator written in the Go language that allows for content written in Markdown to be rendered into HTML webpages.
- GitHub Pages - A GitHub service that hosts web content (such as HTML webpages) stored in a GitHub repository.

In this post, we will show how we can create an own blog for free using the above technologies.

## Create a Github Repository

First, a repository on GitHub for blog is required. A Github account can be created for free here. Once a GitHub account is created, log into your account here.

## Install Hugo

Then, we need to install Hugo on our Linux host. The steps needed to install Hugo vary from one operating system to another, so I recommend referencing Hugoâ€™s installation documentation for more details. Since I am working with an Ubuntu 20.04 host, I will use snap to install Hugo to my Linux host as shown below.
