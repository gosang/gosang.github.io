# Introduction

Deploying applications in Kubernetes can be complex, especially as your infrastructure grows. Helm, an open-source package manager, addresses this challenge by providing a templating and packaging system for Kubernetes manifests. In this blog post, we'll explore Helm, its rationale, implementation, and usage in the context of microservices or modular monolithic architectures.

# What is Helm?

Helm is a tool designed to streamline the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes. Think of it as the package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying the process of defining, installing, and upgrading even the most complex applications.

## Why Helm

As organizations adopted Kubernetes, they faced the need for a standardized way to package, deploy, and manage applications. Helm emerged to provide a solution to the challenges of managing Kubernetes manifests and configurations across different environments.

## Problems Helm Resolves

- **Reusability**: Helm allows users to package applications and their dependencies into reusable and shareable units called Helm charts.
- **Templating**: Helm introduces the concept of templates, enabling parameterization of Kubernetes manifests for dynamic configuration.
- **Versioning**: Helm charts support versioning, making it easier to track changes and rollback to previous releases.

# Helm Charts and Helm Templates: Unveiling the Basic Structure

## Helm Charts

Helm charts are the building blocks of Helm, encapsulating all the necessary information to deploy applications on Kubernetes. Let's dissect the basic structure of a Helm chart:

```plaintext
myapp/
|-- Chart.yaml
|-- values.yaml
|-- templates/
|   |-- deployment.yaml
|   |-- service.yaml
|-- charts/
|-- ...
```

1. `Chart.yaml`: This file provides metadata about the chart, including the chart name, version, description, and other relevant information. It serves as the blueprint for the entire Helm chart.

```yaml
# Example Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: myapp
version: 1.0.0
description: My Application Helm Chart
```

2. `values.yaml`: The values.yaml file contains default configurations and parameters that can be overridden during chart installation. It acts as a central configuration hub, allowing users to customize their deployments.

```yaml
# Example values.yaml
replicaCount: 3
image:
  repository: myapp
  tag: latest
containerPort: 8080
```

- `templates/`: This directory holds the Kubernetes manifest templates. These templates utilize the Go templating language to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests, allowing for parameterization and customization.

- `deployment.yaml`: An example of a Kubernetes Deployment template.

```yaml
# Example templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-myapp
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: {{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}
        ports:
        - containerPort: {{ .Values.containerPort }}
```

- `service.yaml`: An example of a Kubernetes Service template.

```yaml
# Example templates/service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: {{ .Values.containerPort }}
    targetPort: {{ .Values.containerPort }}
```

4. `charts/`: This directory can optionally contain dependencies in the form of subcharts. Subcharts allow you to modularize and reuse common components across multiple charts.

## Helm Templates for Parameterizing Manifests

Helm templates utilize the Go templating syntax to inject dynamic values into Kubernetes manifests. Let's break down a snippet from the `deployment.yaml`template:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-myapp
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: {{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}
        ports:
        - containerPort: {{ .Values.containerPort }}
```

- `{{ .Release.Name }}`: This injects the release name into the manifest, ensuring uniqueness for each deployment.
- `{{ .Values.replicaCount }}`: Refers to the value defined in `values.yaml`, allowing users to customize the number of replicas during installation.
- `{{ .Values.image.repository }}` and `{{ .Values.image.tag }}`: Reference the repository and tag defined in `values.yaml`, enabling users to specify the image details dynamically.

By combining these elements, Helm charts and templates offer a structured and flexible approach to defining, packaging, and deploying applications on Kubernetes.

# Advantages of Helm

- **Standardization**: Helm provides a standardized way to define, share, and version applications in Kubernetes.
- **Templating**: Parameterization simplifies customization and promotes reuse of Helm charts.
- **Rollback**: Helm facilitates easy rollback to previous application versions in case of issues.

# Disadvantages of Helm

- **Learning Curve**: Users new to Helm may face a learning curve due to its features and templating syntax.
- **Complexity**: Helm charts can become complex, especially for large applications, potentially increasing the chance of misconfigurations.

# Issues and Considerations for Helm

- **Security**: Helm Tiller (the server-side component) had security concerns, but Helm 3 has addressed this by removing Tiller.
- **Chart Quality**: Reliability of Helm charts depends on the quality of community-contributed charts. Carefully vetting or creating charts is crucial.

# When to Use Helm: Use Cases/Scenarios

- **Multi-tier Applications**: Helm simplifies deploying and managing multi-tier applications with various dependencies.
- **Microservices or Modular Monolithic Architectures**: Helm is beneficial when managing multiple services or modular components with shared dependencies.

# Best Practices

- **Versioning**: Clearly version your Helm charts to manage application lifecycle changes effectively.
- **Parameterization**: Leverage Helm values and templates for parameterization to enhance chart reusability.
- **Security**: With Helm 3, Tiller is no longer required, improving the security posture. Always use the latest Helm version.
- **Validation**: Use Helm linting tools to validate charts before deployment.

# Conclusion

Helm simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes, addressing challenges related to reusability, templating, and versioning. By understanding Helm charts, templates, and best practices, developers and operators can harness the power of Helm to efficiently deploy and manage applications in diverse Kubernetes environments.
