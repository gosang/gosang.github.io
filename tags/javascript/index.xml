Memory leaks occur when memory that is no longer needed is not released, leading to performance issues over time. In this blog, we will look into memory leaks in JavaScript, their causes, and prevention techniques, with clear examples and best practices.
What Are Memory Leaks in JavaScript? A memory leak happens when a program unintentionally retains memory that it no longer needs, causing the application to consume more memory than required.</description></item><item><title>Callback Promise Async Await in Javascript</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/react/callback-promise-async-await-in-javascript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:34:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/react/callback-promise-async-await-in-javascript/</guid><description>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it executes one operation at a time. But real-world applications often need to handle multiple tasks, like fetching data, reading files, or waiting for user input. To manage these asynchronous operations, JavaScript provides Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await. This blog explores these tools in depth, covering their rationale, usage, advantages, and challenges.
