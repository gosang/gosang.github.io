It is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory namespace and is a simple and lightweight caching solution native to the .NET Core framework.
Key Features: 1. Native Integration:
Seamlessly integrated into the .NET Core framework. No need for additional dependencies or external services. 2. In-Memory Storage:
Utilizes the application&amp;rsquo;s memory to store cached data.</description></item><item><title>Caching Pattern</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/caching/caching-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 08:43:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/caching/caching-pattern/</guid><description>Caching is a crucial aspect of modern software development, especially in the context of microservices or modular monolithic applications. It helps improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance the overall user experience. In this blog post, we will delve into five caching patterns: Cache Aside, Write Through, Read Through, Write Back, and Write Around, exploring their characteristics, use cases, and code snippets using .NET.
1. Cache Aside Overview: Cache Aside, also known as Lazy Loading, is a popular caching pattern where the application code is responsible for managing the cache.</description></item></channel></rss>
