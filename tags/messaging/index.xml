In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the implementation of an event bus with RabbitMQ in .NET Core, focusing on an e-commerce system built using .NET Core services and APIs. We&amp;rsquo;ll leverage MediatR for CQRS, AutoMapper for object mapping, EF Core InMemory database for simplicity, and xUnit for unit tests. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the rationale, implementation steps, advantages, and best practices.</description></item><item><title>Using RabbitMQ with ASP.NET Core</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-principles/messaging/rabbitmq-with-dotnet-core/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 13:58:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-principles/messaging/rabbitmq-with-dotnet-core/</guid><description>In the ever-evolving landscape of modern software development, efficient communication between components is crucial. As applications grow in complexity and adopt microservices architecture, a reliable message broker is essential. RabbitMQ, a powerful open-source message broker, has become a cornerstone technology for achieving scalable and robust communication between different parts of an application. In this blog, we will dive deep into RabbitMQ, explain its rationale, explore how it resolves common problems, and demonstrate its usage with ASP.</description></item></channel></rss>
