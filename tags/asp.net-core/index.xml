The ETag header, or Entity Tag, serves as a powerful mechanism to implement optimistic concurrency. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll thoroughly explore what ETag is, its rationale, how it differs from pessimistic concurrency, and how to leverage it in a .NET Core 8 e-commerce system. Additionally, we&amp;rsquo;ll look into two approaches for optimistic concurrency: one using Database-Generated Tokens and another using Application-Managed Tokens.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Dapper With ASP.Core 6</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/datastore/implementing-dapper-with-asp-dotnet-core-6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 16:58:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/datastore/implementing-dapper-with-asp-dotnet-core-6/</guid><description>Introduction In the realm of data access in ASP.NET Core 6, developers often face choices between various Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools. One such tool that has gained popularity is Dapper. In this blog post, we will look into what Dapper is, its rationale, and how it can be effectively implemented in an ASP.NET Core 6 E-Commerce system.

Released in 2015, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, addressing common issues associated with REST, such as over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
Why GraphQL? The primary goal of GraphQL is to optimize data retrieval. Traditional REST APIs often force clients to accept fixed responses, leading to over-fetching (receiving more data than necessary) or under-fetching (not receiving enough data, necessitating multiple requests).</description></item></channel></rss>
