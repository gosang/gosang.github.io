This is where Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes into play â€” an architectural pattern and protocol designed to optimize, standardize, and streamline how context is managed in LLM-powered systems.
In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore:

In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll look into what LLMs are, their surge in popularity, how they function, their real-world applications, their advantages and limitations, as well as potential risks. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss when to use LLMs and explore future applications and research directions.
What is a Large Language Model? A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human language.</description></item></channel></rss>
