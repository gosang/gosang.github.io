Among them, Factory Patterns are widely used to encapsulate object creation, providing a flexible way to instantiate objects without specifying their exact classes. In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore three types of Factory Patterns: Concrete, Static, and Abstract, discussing their rationale, usage in an e-commerce system with C# .NET Core examples, advantages, disadvantages, and best practices.

This pattern belongs to the structural design patterns, emphasizing the decoupling of abstraction from implementation. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the intricacies of the Bridge pattern, its rationale, usage in microservices, and practical implementations in a C# .NET Core e-commerce system.
Bridge Pattern Overview The Bridge pattern is a structural pattern that separates abstraction from its implementation so that both can evolve independently without affecting each other.</description></item><item><title>Prototype Pattern</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/creational/prototype-pattern/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 13:09:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/creational/prototype-pattern/</guid><description>The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that focuses on creating objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern allows you to create new objects by duplicating an existing one, providing a convenient way to produce new instances without specifying their exact types. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the Prototype pattern, its rationale, implementation in C# .NET Core, and its relevance in the context of microservices and modular monolithic architectures.</description></item><item><title>Interpreter Pattern</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/structural/interpreter-pattern/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 13:00:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/structural/interpreter-pattern/</guid><description>In the realm of design patterns, the Interpreter pattern stands out as a powerful tool for solving specific types of problems. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of the Interpreter pattern, exploring what it is, its rationale, applications in the context of microservices or modular monolithic architectures, and providing practical examples using C# .NET Core.
What is the Interpreter Pattern? The Interpreter pattern falls under the behavioral design patterns category.</description></item><item><title>Composite Pattern</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/structural/composite-pattern/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 12:56:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/structural/composite-pattern/</guid><description>The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In simpler terms, it enables you to work with both individual objects and groups of objects in a unified manner.
Rationale behind the Composite Pattern The primary goal of the Composite Pattern is to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.</description></item><item><title>Observer Pattern</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/behavioral/observer-pattern/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 12:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/behavioral/observer-pattern/</guid><description>In software development, designing systems that are flexible, scalable, and maintainable is paramount. One of the key challenges is establishing a communication mechanism between components without tight coupling. The Observer pattern provides an elegant solution to this problem. In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the intricacies of the Observer pattern, explore its applications in an e-commerce system using C# .NET Core, and discuss best practices.
Understanding the Observer Pattern The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, that are notified of state changes.</description></item></channel></rss>
