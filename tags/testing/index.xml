In ASP.NET Core, xUnit is a popular testing framework due to its flexibility, powerful features, and ease of use. This blog post will explore the essentials of testing in ASP.NET Core using xUnit, including practical examples with InlineData, MemberData, ClassData, and TheoryData. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover the advantages, disadvantages, and best practices for each approach.</description></item><item><title>Software Architecture Testing in .NET Core Using ArchUnit</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/dotnet/software-architecture-testing-in-dotnet-using-archunit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 12:18:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/dotnet/software-architecture-testing-in-dotnet-using-archunit/</guid><description>In the dynamic world of software development, maintaining robust architecture is paramount. Architectural integrity ensures that our systems are scalable, maintainable, and reliable. However, verifying these architectural constraints can be challenging. This is where ArchUnit comes into playâ€”a powerful tool that can revolutionize how we test and enforce architecture in .NET Core projects.
What is ArchUnit? ArchUnit is an open-source library that provides a fluent API for writing architecture tests in Java and .</description></item><item><title>Load Stress Testing Dotnet Core Web Api With Apache Jmeter</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/testing/load-stress-testing-dotnet-core-web-api-with-apache-jmeter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:13:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/testing/load-stress-testing-dotnet-core-web-api-with-apache-jmeter/</guid><description>Load and stress testing are essential aspects of ensuring the performance and reliability of web APIs. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look into how to effectively conduct load and stress testing for ASP.NET Core 8 Web API using Apache JMeter. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the rationale behind load and stress testing, their advantages and disadvantages, detailed methodologies, and best practices.
