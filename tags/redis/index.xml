In the context of microservices or modular monolithic applications, implementing Redis as a Cache Service is a powerful strategy. In this blog post, we will explore what Redis is, the rationale behind using it as a Cache Service, its implementation in an e-commerce system using .NET Core, and best practices.</description></item><item><title>Difference Between Imemorycache and Redis</title><link>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/caching/difference-between-imemorycache-and-redis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 08:43:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gosang.github.io/posts/design-patterns/caching/difference-between-imemorycache-and-redis/</guid><description>Caching is a pivotal technique in optimizing application performance, and in the world of .NET Core, developers have two powerful tools at their disposal: .NET Core IMemoryCache and Redis Caching. Each solution has distinct characteristics and is tailored for specific use cases.
.NET Core IMemoryCache Overview: In .NET Core, the IMemoryCache interface is a built-in caching mechanism that provides an in-memory store for frequently accessed data. It is part of the Microsoft.</description></item></channel></rss>
